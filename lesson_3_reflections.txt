When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When I want to share the code via GitHub
    When I want to work on code from multiple platforms
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	So I can chose what and when to do a pull

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are to make a copy of someone's branch in GITHUB, making your new 	branch in GITHUB.  Use it when you don't have rights to change 
		their copy or you want to do something independent of the original
	Clones are a local repository copy in your environment, a copy of 
		the branch in GITHUB.  Use it to make a local copy and work from.
	Branches are changes to the code that traces back to an original commit,
		but does not tie to every commit.  Use branches to develop new 
		features independently of others working on the master or other
		branches.  You can merge branches later.
