What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Initializing a reporsitory causes git metadata to be written into the
	hidden .git directory.  This will allow git to track information about 
	commits and saved files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Allows you to identify files to be committed in a group with a
	single commit comments.
	Allows you to keep commits logically grouped.
